The first volume of the book *Applied Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology: Analysis of distribution, abundance and species richness in R and BUGS* by Marc KÃ©ry and Andy Royle appeared early in 2016. The second volume is scheduled for publication in April 2020. See the [book web page](http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/keryroylebook/).

A number of R functions and data sets are needed to complement the code in the book, and these are included in this R package. The current release on CRAN, version 0.1.4, has the material for Volume 1. The development version on GitHub, 0.1.4.9xxx, contains additional material for Volume 2, and is subject to frequent revision as the manuscript changes.

AHMbook 0.2.0, including all the new material, will be submitted to CRAN before publication of Volume 2.

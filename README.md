The first volume of the book *Applied Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology: Analysis of distribution, abundance and species richness in R and BUGS* by Marc KÃ©ry and Andy Royle appeared early in 2016, the second volume in October 2020. See the [book web page](http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/keryroylebook/).

A number of R functions and data sets are needed to complement the code in the book, and these are included in this R package.

Ken Kellner has taken over maintenance of the `AHMbook` package as of August 2023. All issues and pull requests should be submitted to this repository. The original repository is [here](https://github.com/mikemeredith/AHMbook).

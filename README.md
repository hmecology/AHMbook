The first volume of the book *Applied Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology: Analysis of distribution, abundance and species richness in R and BUGS* by Marc KÃ©ry and Andy Royle appeared early in 2016. The second volume is scheduled for publication in September 2020. See the [book web page](http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/keryroylebook/).

A number of R functions and data sets are needed to complement the code in the book, and these are included in this R package. The current release on CRAN, version 0.2.0, has the material for Volumes 1 and 2. 

The development version on GitHub, 0.2.0.9xxx contains recent updates of the Volume 2 material and some fixes for Volume 1 material - see the `NEWS` file.
